Originally developed by Jahn, Schmid and Schrag [1947].\r\n\r\nMore information on measures of segregation can be found at https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/2958220 \r\n\r\nMultiyear estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) are &#34;period&#34; estimates derived from a data sample collected over a period of time, as opposed to &#34;point-in-time&#34; estimates such as those from past decennial censuses. ACS 5-year estimate includes data collected over a 60-month period. The date of the data is the end of the 5-year period. For example, a value dated 2014 represents data from 2010 to 2014. However, they  do  not  describe  any  specific day, month, or year within that time period.\r\n\r\nMultiyear  estimates  require  some  considerations  that  single-year  estimates  do  not.  For  example,  multiyear  estimates released in consecutive years consist mostly of overlapping years and shared data. The 2010\u20132014 ACS 5-year estimates share sample data from 2011 through 2014 with the 2011\u20132015 ACS 5-year estimates. Because of this overlap, users should use extreme caution in making comparisons with consecutive years of multiyear estimates.\r\n\r\nPlease see &#34;Section 3: Understanding and Using ACS Single-Year and Multiyear Estimates&#34; on publication page 13 (file page 19) of the 2018 ACS General Handbook for a more thorough clarification. https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/acs/acs_general_handbook_2018.pdf"
