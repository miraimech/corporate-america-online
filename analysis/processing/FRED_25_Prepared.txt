The Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) were developed by the IMF, together with the international community, with the aim of supporting macroprudential analysis and assessing strengths and vulnerabilities of financial systems. The website, hosted by the Statistics Department of the IMF, disseminates data and metadata on selected FSIs provided by participating countries. For a description of the various FSIs, as well as the consolidation basis, consolidation adjustments, and accounting rules followed, please refer to the “Concepts and Definitions” document ( The Statistics Department will steadily increase the number of countries reporting FSIs for dissemination on this site. Reporting countries compile FSI data presented on this website by using different methodologies, which may also vary for different points in time for the same country. Users are advised to consult the accompanying metadata ( to conduct more meaningful cross-country comparisons or to assess the evolution of a given FSI for any of the countries.
