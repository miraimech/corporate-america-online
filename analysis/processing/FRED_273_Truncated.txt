        "releases_285_notes": "Indeed calculates the percentage change in seasonally-adjusted job postings since February 1, 2020, using a 7-day trailing average. February 1, 2020, is the pre-pandemic baseline. Indeed seasonally adjusts each series based on historical patterns in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Each series, including the national trend, occupational sectors, and sub-national geographies, is seasonally adjusted separately. Indeed switched to this new methodology in January 2021 and now reports all historical data using this new methodology. Historical numbers have been revised and may differ significantly from originally reported values. The new methodology applies a detrended seasonal adjustment factor to the percentage change in job postings.\r\n\r\nIndices are calculated for the U.S., Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, France, and the U.K. In addition for the U.S., indices are calculated for states, the largest metro areas by population.\r\n\r\nFor Frequently Asked Questions regarding Indeed Data, visit https://www.hiringlab.org/indeed-data-faq/.\r\n\r\nCopyrighted: Pre-approval required.
