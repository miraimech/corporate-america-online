AMERIBOR® (American Interbank Offered Rate) is a transparent benchmark interest rate based on overnight unsecured loans transacted on the American Financial Exchange (AFX). AMERIBOR® reflects the actual borrowing costs of thousands of small, medium, and regional banks across America. AMERIBOR® is also useful for larger banks and financial institutions that do business with these banks, as well as small and middle market companies.
